The cocoon requires both comms to be held for 10 minutes. If any of the comms are lost or the cocoon itself is the destroyed it will despawn and will be on cooldown for 5-15 minutes. Can be rebought like most other buffs. All living xenos can vote for a candidate after which one of the top 2 will be randomally picked, otherwise a player is randomly selected from all living xenos > 50 hours (will fallbacks to ghosts and then again with no playtime requirements). Evacuating while the destroyer is hatching will cause it to instantly hatch."
